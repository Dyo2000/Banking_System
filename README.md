# Banking_System
 Hello, this is my attempt to make a banking system.\
 I am doing this as a solo project for experience.\

 Update on 9/30/2023 - This project is taking a lot of time and research.\
 Had to do a lot of research into html, but have figured out the basics.\
 The next part is figuring out how to register a user.\
 Once a user is registered into the system I need it to be able to save variables.\
 I want these variables to be used, such as their name say "Welcome 'User' ".\
 Then obivously in this database it would have the users balances and such.\
